# Documentation State

## Purpose and limitation

This file records explicit review dependencies and SHA-256 hashes for maintained regular files recursively under `docs/`. It excludes itself and `docs/ref/`. A hash proves only that exact bytes changed after the last acknowledgement; it does not prove semantic accuracy, so reviewers must inspect the changed document and the listed dependents before running `make docs-state-update`.

The dependency table expresses review impact rather than link direction. When a source document changes, review its listed dependents for assumptions, terminology, commands, or contracts that may also need updates. `None` means no additional dependent is currently declared, not that the document can be changed without review.

## Commands

Use `./build/doccheck state check` or `make check-docs` to compare exact bytes without writing. After reviewing each changed document and the dependency guidance above, use `make docs-state-update` to acknowledge the reviewed state.
